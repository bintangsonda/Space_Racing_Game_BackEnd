STEP-BY-STEP TO RUN THE PROJECT ON YOUR WEB HOSTING:

Open the file manager of your hosting
Upload the zip file to your hosting file manager and extract it
Create a database in your web hosting
Go to PhpMyAdmin
Inside your database, create a table named mbs_mid (or you may change it to whatever you want, but you need to rename all sql requests in the php code later)
In mbs_mid table, create a structure like this:
